# reviewbot

From Make-a-bot Meetup #2.

To install, first `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then follow [spaCy model setup instructions here](https://spacy.io/docs#install-model) to download the spaCy language models.

Then run it using `python reviewbot.py`.

## Stretch goals:

* Integrate it with Twitter
* Make it handle this sentence: “What do you think of *my* socks?” -> “I *** *your* socks”
* Make it run on Heroku
